LTLTL is an experimental/escape-room/soulslike/endless-runner/working-simulator/erotic/strategy/action-rpg/violent/non-violent/philosophical/pseudophilosophical/lgbt/lgbtqiapn+/post-modern/post-post-structuralist  game/content/experience/"game".  
  
LTLTL overcomes all games that came before it. They were mere distorted expressions of the absolute spirit of games. This essence, neither absolute nor spiritual, transcends and immanently encompasses reality, which is itself but an illusion.  

LTLTL provides us with a means to establish a secure foundation for ethics (what ought to be done) and epistemology (what can be known) in ontology (what truly is). Thus, we can finally address the age-old inquiries:  

- Are games art (ontology)?  
- How do we know something is a game (epistemology)?  
- How do we recover ethics in game journalism (ethics)?  

With the discovery of this material and spiritual foundation of ontological truth, LTLTL offers us a way to finally ground our knowledge and actions in Being itself.  

For all the most pressing questions of our time - the questions of all times, the question of Time itself -, LTLTL presents a response. An absolute and true answer, which, of course, means it can only be spoken not-whole. It is barely an answer at all, as it resolves nothing and opens us up to everything. An answer that can only be hinted at. It cannot be spoken - it can only be experienced.  

Truth was forgotten by Thought; we can rediscover it through Play.
